What You Own, Owns You: Clean your life

“You are not your job, you’re not how much money you have in the bank.
You are not the car you drive.
You’re not the contents of your wallet.
You are not your fucking khakis. 
You are all singing, all dancing crap of the world.” ― Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club

1. Don't buy new stuff untill you get rid of old one
2. Don't move stuff which you not use more than year - sale,giveaway or just left.
3. Don't buy anything bigger than your suitcase for travelling
4. Don't buy just funny souvenirs from your travels - only practical one - food, tea, wine, chocolate or etc. 
Souvenirs, which you can eat/drink.
5. The most stupid investemnts - in cloth - never buy expensive things. Fashion very quickly  changes and you will keep this stuff even you not wear it
